# Impressionist-Art-with-Genetic-Algorithm
Create an impressionist rendering of any image, using a genetic algorithm. Written in JavaScript.

This tool can be run in your web browser. Upload an image of your choice, and a genetic algorithm will evolve a population of small blotches to create a new image that will become more and more similar to the input image. The result is an impressionist-like rendering of the initial image that is aesthetically very interesting. 

Below are some examples of art generated by this tool.
